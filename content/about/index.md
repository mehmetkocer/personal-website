title = "About Me"
+++

I am a cloud-first data engineer who is eager to develop useful solutions and is excited to learn new technologies. I focused on solution not the technology, and always read for understanding the problem before diving into coding it. I listen to my teammates carefully and loves to give or receive any kind of feedback.
